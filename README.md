# Networking Project2
## Abstract/Objectives
This repository contains a report detailing a project aimed at gaining a comprehensive understanding of key networking concepts and protocols, specifically DHCP, DNS, and ICMP. The objectives also include practical skills development in using Wireshark for packet analysis and implementing network designs using Packet Tracer. By achieving these objectives, participants enhance their knowledge of computer networks and gain hands-on experience in network configuration and troubleshooting.

A detailed list of figures & tables & contents included in the report is provided.
